Per instructions - strongly encouraged to reference Module 2 Tutorial Lab in Redux course (still haven't finished)

"User Stories"
1. I would like to enter something to do into a list

2. I would like to remove the todo when the task is complete

3. I would like to cross out some tasks instead of remove them

User stories:

1. User stories 

2. "Wireframe" - don't understand those still - also no feedback on my last two projects. 

3. Write out your app's state tree (figure out what a state tree is)

4. List out all the actions related to redux that will take place in your app (Add_Item) - maybe compile at the end?

5. Write out a list of the container and presentational components you intend to use in your app - what does this mean?

Development phase:

1. Create a GitHub repository on Github.com - done

2. Clone it to your local machine - done

3. Make frequent todos + description - easy enough

Technical requirements:

1. Create React app - easy enough

2. Redux should be used to handle the state in our app related directly to the "todos" (todos list filter selection etc.) - this is fairly confusing, I am not code literate enough to understand what's truly different about react and redux. I just understand that I make the app and can use the Redux to create the server. What is really different about the code? Seems like it is all just some weird form of javascript. 

3. The app should contain at least two view: /todos and /contact - makes more sense, are they really called views?

4. When /todos is clicked, they should be presented wth a view that:
    -Display a list of the todo items currently contained in the Redux store (does that mean in console tool? probably but double check)
    -Display a form (text input and submit button - html + redux forget where but plenty of examples in last two weeks lessons) that allows users to add a new item to the list
    -Offers a way for a task to be marked as "completed" and clearly indicates this status visually (strike through effect) - what is that? is that the right term? check calss videos to see if that was ever used. Maybe I'm just having a brain fart. 
    -Offers a way for the task to be removed from the list 
    -Offersa way to view either
        -all todos
        -completed todos
        -incomplete todos
    -When todos are added/updated/marked as complete, these changes should immediately be reflected in your redux store visible via redux devtools (what even is that?)
5. When a user navigates to /contact , they should be presented with a view that:
    -Displays a contact form that displays the following fields
        -first name field
        -last name field
        -email field
        -comments field
        -Renders a "the form" (grammar error, or is 'the form' a thing?) as a controlled component such that after entering text into any of the fields, the form's state has changed (reference screenshot on pdf)
    
6. There should be at least 10 custom CSS rules used throughout the components of your react app - what does this mean? what is a custom CSS rule for a React component? does the script need React CSS in it?

7. You must have a horizontal nav bar at the top of your site - shouldn't be too tough / reference first project and lesson Karl gave (I believe it was second class last week of august)

8. You must have at least one example of content side-by-side (can't find photo - ask?) 

Deliverables: 
1. User stories
2. Wireframes ? do last 
3. Your state tree (what's a state tree?) and list of actions from the planning phase
4. List container (what's that?) and presentational components (what's that?) from the planning phase
5. app available in GitHub (easy enough)
6. a readme.md file with
    -Name
    -Overview
    -Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered
    -Technologies used
    -ideas for improvement.
7. Your repository should contain at least 15 commits and shoul reflect a consistent commit history. (what is meant by consistent?)
